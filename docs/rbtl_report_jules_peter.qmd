abstract: 
  Around 43% of worlds population does not have access to safe sanitation. In my PhD I will research a new approach to treat faeces using filamentous fungi. The goal of the research is to find fungal species that grow on human faeces and help reduce concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria. To be able to compare the growth speed and antibacterial effect of different fungal species a data analysis is necessary. With this report the way to manage and analyse the data was created.

# Exploring fungi for faecal treatment

# Introduction

Globally, 43% of the population lacks access to safe sanitation [@population], leading to the spread of diarrheal diseases and environmental contamination from untreated faecal sludge. While urine diversion dry toilets (UDDTs) offer a potential solution by separating nutrient-rich and safe urine for fertilizer, the treatment of faeces is still a challenge. Long storage times and potential pathogen reactivation in dried faeces remain can be a risk for spreading of disease[@kumwenda2017].

The introduction of filamentous fungi, to sanitize faeces is a novel approach yet to be studied. Fungi are powerful decomposers in nature, utilizing enzymes to break down complex organic matter [@berg2020]. Coprophilous fungi, adapted to nutrient-rich dung, have evolved mechanisms to thrive in environments with high microbial competition, they are able to sense bacteria and produce antibacterial compounds up on recognition [@kombrink2019inductiona]. Interestingly, preliminary research indicates that even non-dung-adapted white-rot fungi can colonize human faeces and reduce odour.

This doctoral thesis aims to investigate the potential of fungal species to utilize faeces as a nutrient source, reduce the concentration of harmful bacteria, and alter the physical properties of the faecal mass. Understanding these processes could lead to the development of an effective and sustainable method for treating faecal waste in UDDTs, mitigating health risks and shortening the required storage time for safe disposal or agricultural use.

Within this lecture of Research beyond the lab (RBTL) the code for data cleaning and analysis will be developed and tested using a example data set with simulated fungal growth and bacteria data. In order to test the capability of fungi to grow on human faeces, a petri dish based assay will be developed to measure growth speed and log-change of E. coli and Enterococcus before and after fungal over growth.

# Methods

The data structure will be created in the following way. [@fig-1]

```{r}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Datastructure to be used in the experiments,The tables on the left will be linked over a experimnt table. Two tables will be created one to analyse the growth and one to analyse the change of bacterial concentrations" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/data_structure.jpg")
```

For the different task of the experiment separate tables will be generated.

-   faeces_1_1: Contains the data of the faecal collection creating one row of data for each faecal collection campaign.
-   inoculum_1_1: Stores the data for the inoculum used in the experiments.
-   bacterial_analysis_1_1: Contains the data about bacteria concentration after fungal co-incubation.
-   growth_speed_analysis_1_1: In this table each row will refer to a area size measured by image analysis for each picture
-   experiments_1_1: This table will store the experimental set up linking together all the tables using shared IDs

Tables will be created using google_sheets, and stored on google drive. Data analysis and figures are created using R (Rstudio V.2025.05.0Â Build 496). An R-script for Loading the relevant data (01-data_download) another one cleans the data and prepare it for the analysis (02-data_cleaning.R). These R scripts are stored in the folder fungal-faecal-treatment/R. Data files being saved in the folder data processed with their corresponding name for the analysis as CSV files. (growth_speed_analysis and bacteria_analysis)

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-2
#| fig-cap: "creating Q-Q plot to see mean growth speed distribution for each species" 

###Testing data for normal distribution e_coli 
mean_growth_speed_species <- growth_speed_analysis|>
  filter(species!= "Control")|>
  dplyr::select(species, mean_growth_speed)

###qq-plot for each species 
ggplot(mean_growth_speed_species, aes(sample = `mean_growth_speed`)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(vars( species)) +
  geom_qq_line(color = "purple")
```

The Q-Q plot [@fig-2] indicates that the growth speed of C. comatus follows normal distribution, for Faecal Isolate 1 there is a slight deviation from the line which indicates some deviation from a normal distribution. For P. ostreatus the data seems to be skewed in both ends which suggest that the data does not follow normal distribution. The Shapiro test [@tbl-1] on the data showed that *P. ostreatus* does not follow normal distribution.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-1
#| tbl-cap: "Shapiro-test for testing mean growth speed of fungal species for normal distibution" 

shapiro_mean_growth_speed_species <- mean_growth_speed_species |>
  group_by(species)|>
  shapiro_test(mean_growth_speed)

shapiro_mean_growth_speed_species|>
  gt()|>
  tab_caption("Shapiro-test for testing mean growth speed of fungal species for normal distibution")

```

The shapiro test verifies the normal distribution for *C. comatus* and faecal isolate 1 while it shows violation of normal distribution for *P. ostreatus v. Floridae.* [@fig-3] shows the median of the mean growth speed and distribution of the different fungal species in a Box-plot. Also here we can see that the median of *P. ostreatus* is shifted.

```{r}
#| label: fig-3
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot showing median and distribution of mean growth speed values for different fungal species"

#Remove control from growth speed assays 
growth_speed_analysis|>
   filter(species != "Control")|>
  ggplot(growth_speed_analysis,
       mapping=aes(x=species, y=mean_growth_speed))+
  labs(
    title = "Mean growthspeed by Species",
    x = "Species",
    y ="Growth rate [cm^2/day]",
    color = "Species") +
  geom_boxplot()
```

Since the mean growth speed is not normal distributed it would be recommended to use a test that allows not normal distributed data like Kruskal-Wallis test. This script should be able to handle both cases first an analysis of variance (anova) is done on the data set. To test if the mean growth of the different fungi are different from each other. The anova [@tbl-2] with a Tukey post-hoc analysis analysis [@tbl-3] shows that there is no significant difference in the mean growth speed between the different species for any of the pairs.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-2
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA testing significane of growth speed between different species"

#Statistical analysis for growth speed

###ANOVA for growth speed between different species
growth_speed_anova <- mean_growth_speed_species |>
  anova_test(mean_growth_speed ~ species)
  growth_speed_anova|>
gt()
  



```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-3
#| tbl-cap: "Tukey test results comparing growth speed between the treatments"

growth_speed_tukey_results <- mean_growth_speed_species |>
  tukey_hsd(mean_growth_speed ~ species)

growth_speed_tukey_results|>
  gt()
```

To complete the test setting the data will also be analysed using statistical tests that do not need normal distributed data. In this case a Kruskal-Wallis test [@tbl-4] and a Dunn post-hoc analysis [@tbl-5] are done

```{r}
#| label: tbl-4
#| tbl-cap: "Kruskal_wallis test significane of growth speed between different species if normal data is not normal distributed"


# Make sure 'species' is a factor
growth_speed_analysis <- growth_speed_analysis |>
  mutate(species = as.factor(species))

# Perform the Kruskal-Wallis test using rstatix
kruskal_result_growth_speed <- growth_speed_analysis |>
  kruskal_test(mean_growth_speed ~ species)


 kruskal_growth_speed_table <- kruskal_result_growth_speed|>
  select(-.y.) %>% # Remove the '.y.' column for cleaner output
  gt()
  
kruskal_growth_speed_table  
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-5
#| tbl-cap: "Dunn test significane of growth speed between different species if normal data is not normal distributed"

dunn_result <- growth_speed_analysis |>
  dunn_test(mean_growth_speed ~ species, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")|>
  gt()

# Print the Dunn's test results
dunn_result
```

Neither of the used tests under assuming normal distribution or rejecting normal distribution (rshowed significant results between the growth speed of the fungal species in this simulated data set.

## Analysis of bacterial concentration changes

In this section the bacteria log-change for *E. coli* and *E. faecalis* will be analysed. The log change is calculated from the original measured bacteria concentration from the faecal table and the measured value after co-incubation. and shows how many 10 log the bacterial concentration is reduced

To test the collected data for normal distribution we will make a qq-plot and a shapiro test

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-6
#| tbl-cap: "Shapiro-test for E coli log change in fungal treated faeces compared to uninoculated control"

###Testing data for normal distribution e_coli 
ecoli_log <- bacteria_analysis|>
  dplyr::select(species, log_change_ecoli)

shapiro_ecoli <- ecoli_log |>
  group_by(species)|>
  shapiro_test(log_change_ecoli)

shapiro_ecoli|>
  gt()
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-5
#| fig-cap: "q-q plot for testing for normal distribution of E. coli log change"

###qq-plot for each species 
ggplot(ecoli_log, aes(sample = `log_change_ecoli`)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(vars( species)) +
  geom_qq_line(color = "purple")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-7
#| tbl-cap: "Shapiro-test for E. faecalis log change in fungal treated faeces compared to uninoculated control"
###Testing data for normal distribution enterococcus 
enterococcus_log <- bacteria_analysis|>
  dplyr::select(species, log_change_enterococcus)

shapiro_enterococcus <- enterococcus_log |>
  group_by(species)|>
  shapiro_test(log_change_enterococcus)

shapiro_enterococcus|>
  gt()

```

The Shapiro test [@tbl-6] and the Q-Q plots [@fig-5] showing that the created log change data for *E. coli* and *E. faecalis*[@tbl-7]and [@fig-6] is normal distributed. This normal distribution allows to use an ANOVA for the data analysis and a Tukey post-hoc analysis to test between different pairs.

```{r}
#| label: fig-6
#| fig-cap: "q-q plot for testing normal distribution of log-change of E. faecalis"

###qq-plot for each species 
ggplot(enterococcus_log, aes(sample = `log_change_enterococcus`)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(vars( species)) +
  geom_qq_line(color = "purple")

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-8
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA for testing of significant differences in E. coli logchange in different fungal species and control"

#Statistical analysis for E. coli and Enterococcus

###ANOVA for ecoli
ecoli_anova <- ecoli_log |>
  anova_test(log_change_ecoli ~ species)  
ecoli_anova|>
  gt()


```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-9
#| tbl-cap: "Tukey for pairwise comparison of E. coli logchange in different fungal species and control"

tukey_results <- ecoli_log |>
  tukey_hsd(log_change_ecoli ~ species)

# Add significance symbols/letters
tukey_results_formatted <- tukey_results |>
add_significance("p.adj") |>
  mutate(p.adj = scales::pvalue(p.adj))

tukey_results_formatted|>
  gt()
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-10
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA for testing of significant differences in E. faecalis logchange in different fungal species and control"

### ANOVA for Enterococcus
enterococcus_anova <- enterococcus_log |>
  anova_test(log_change_enterococcus ~ species)  
enterococcus_anova|>
  gt()


```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-11
#| tbl-cap: "Tukey for pairwise comparison of E. faecalis log-change in different fungal species and control"

tukey_results <- enterococcus_log |>
  tukey_hsd(log_change_enterococcus ~ species)
tukey_results|>
  gt()

```

Graphical of the log change for both bacteria compared to control

```{r}
##Both in one plot preparing data

log_change_both <- bacteria_analysis |>
  pivot_longer(
    # Select both log-change columns
    cols = starts_with("log_change_"), 
    # New column for bacteria type
    names_to = "bacteria", 
    # New column for log-change values
    values_to = "log_change"            
  )  

log_change_both$species <- factor(log_change_both$species, levels = c("Control", "P.ostreatus v. Floridae", "C.comatus", "faecal isolate 1"))


  


```

```{r}
#| label: fig-7
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot comparing log change for E. coli and E. faeclis between treatments"

ggplot(log_change_both, aes(x = species, y = log_change, fill = bacteria)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Species",
    y = "Log Change",
    fill = "Bacteria Species",
    title = "Bacterial Log Change Comparison by Species"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("log_change_ecoli" = "purple", "log_change_enterococcus" = "coral"),
    labels = c("E. coli", "E. faecalis")
  ) +
  #Making lines separating the different species
    geom_vline(xintercept = 1.5, color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5,  color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.5, color = "white")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), panel.grid.major = element_blank())
```

In the created data set there are significant differences in *E. coli* and *E. faecalis* log change between the groups p \<0.05 [@tbl-8] and [@tbl-11]. The Tukey post-hoc analysis for *E. coli* [@tbl-9] shows that the fungal treatment using *P. ostreatus* and *C. comatus* are significantly different to the control and the faecal isolate 1. While the control and faecal isolate one are not different to each other. For *E. faecalis* the *P. ostreatus* is significant higher compared to all the other treatments while the other treatment s are not different to each other [@tbl-11].

# Conclusions

The produced data structure and scripts can be used on the test data set, to visualize mean growth speed differences between species and log-change of bacterial concentrations before and after fungal growth. The statistical tests ANOVA and Tukey can be used to test normal distributed data while Kruskal -Wallis and Dunn test can be used for the not normal distributed data. To test the script on the real collected data might need some adptions due to improvements that have to be done on the assay.
