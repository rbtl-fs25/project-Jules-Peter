abstract: 
  Around 43% of worlds population does not have access to safe sanitation. In my PhD I will research a new approach to treat faeces using filamentous fungi. The goal of the research is to find fungal species that grow on human faeces and help reduce concentrations of faecal indicator bacteria. To be able to compare the growth speed and antibacterial effect of different fungal species a data analysis is necessary. With this report the way to manage and analyse the data was created.

# Exploring fungi for faecal treatment

# Introduction

Globally, 43% of the population lacks access to safe sanitation [@population], leading to the spread of diarrheal diseases and environmental contamination from untreated faecal sludge. While urine diversion dry toilets (UDDTs) offer a potential solution by separating nutrient-rich and safe urine for fertilizer, the treatment of faeces is still a challenge. Long storage times and potential pathogen reactivation in dried faeces remain can be a risk for spreading of disease[@kumwenda2017].

The introduction of filamentous fungi, to sanitize faeces is a novel approach yet to be studied. Fungi are powerful decomposers in nature, utilizing enzymes to break down complex organic matter [@berg2020]. Coprophilous fungi, adapted to nutrient-rich dung, have evolved mechanisms to thrive in environments with high microbial competition, they are able to sense bacteria and produce antibacterial compounds up on recognition [@kombrink2019inductiona]. Interestingly, preliminary research indicates that even non-dung-adapted white-rot fungi can colonize human faeces and reduce odour.

This doctoral thesis aims to investigate the potential of fungal species to utilize faeces as a nutrient source, reduce the concentration of harmful bacteria, and alter the physical properties of the faecal mass. Understanding these processes could lead to the development of an effective and sustainable method for treating faecal waste in UDDTs, mitigating health risks and shortening the required storage time for safe disposal or agricultural use.

Within this lecture of Research beyond the lab (RBTL) the code for data cleaning and analysis will be developed and tested using a example data set with simulated fungal growth and bacteria data. In order to test the capability of fungi to grow on human faeces, a petri dish based assay will be developed to measure growth speed and log-change of E. coli and Enterococcus before and after fungal over growth.

# Methods

For the different steps of the experiment separate tables will be generated. [@fig-1]

-   faeces_1_1: Contains the data of the faecal collection creating one row of data for each faecal collection campaign.
-   inoculum_1_1: Stores the data for the inoculum used in the experiments.
-   bacterial_analysis_1_1: Contains the data about bacteria concentration after fungal co-incubation.
-   growth_speed_analysis_1_1: In this table each row will refer to a area size measured by image analysis for each picture
-   experiments_1_1: This table will store the experimental set up linking together all the tables using shared IDs

```{r}
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Datastructure to be used in the experiments,The tables on the left will be linked over a experimnt table. Two tables will be created one to analyse the growth and one to analyse the change of bacterial concentrations" 
knitr::include_graphics("images/data_structure.jpg")
```

Tables will be created using google_sheets, and stored on google drive. Data analysis and figures are created using R (Rstudio V.2025.05.0 Build 496).

R-script for Loading the relevant data (01-data_download) and for cleaning the data and prepare it for the analysis (02-data_cleaning.R) will be created. These R scripts are stored in the folder Project-Jules-Peter/R. Data files being saved in the folder data processed with their corresponding name for the analysis as CSV files. (growth_speed_analysis and bacteria_analysis)

Data for these analysis is created by entering random numbers that are in a realistic range to be expected in the real experiments.

```

The Q-Q plot [@fig-2] indicates that the growth speed of *Coprinus comatus* follows normal distribution, for Faecal Isolate 1 there is a slight deviation from the line which indicates some deviation from a normal distribution. For *Pleurotus ostreatus* the data seems to be skewed in both ends which suggest that the data does not follow normal distribution.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-1
#| tbl-cap: "Shapiro-test for testing mean growth speed of fungal species for normal distibution" 

shapiro_mean_growth_speed_species <- mean_growth_speed_species |>

  shapiro_test(mean_growth_speed)

shapiro_mean_growth_speed_species|>
  gt()|>
  tab_caption("Shapiro-test for testing mean growth speed of fungal species for normal distibution")

```

The Shapiro-Wilk test verifies the normal distribution for *C. comatus* and faecal isolate 1 while it shows violation of normal distribution for *P. ostreatus v. Floridae* [@tbl-1]*.* [@fig-3] shows the median of the mean growth speed and distribution of the different fungal species in a Box-plot. Also here we can see that the median of *P. ostreatus* is shifted to the lower quantile.

```{r}
#| label: fig-3
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot showing median and distribution of mean growth speed values for different fungal species"

#Remove control from growth speed assays 
growth_speed_analysis|>
   filter(species != "Control")|>
  ggplot(growth_speed_analysis,
       mapping=aes(x=species, y=mean_growth_speed))+
  labs(
    title = "Mean growthspeed by Species",
    x = "Species",
    y ="Growth rate [cm^2/day]",
    color = "Species") +
  geom_boxplot()
```

As the mean growth speed is not normally distributed, a non-parametric test like the Kruskal-Wallis test would usually be recommended. But with the prepared script we want to be able to test both options. To test for differences in the mean growth among the different fungi with normally distributed growth speed values, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the dataset. The ANOVA [@tbl-2] followed by a Tukey post-hoc analysis [@tbl-3] indicated no significant difference in the mean growth speed between any of the species pairs

```{r}
#| label: tbl-2
#| tbl-cap: "ANOVA testing significane of growth speed between different species"

#Statistical analysis for growth speed

###ANOVA for growth speed between different species
growth_speed_anova <- mean_growth_speed_species |>
  anova_test(mean_growth_speed ~ species)
  growth_speed_anova|>
gt()
  



```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-3
#| tbl-cap: "Tukey test results comparing growth speed between the treatments"

growth_speed_tukey_results <- mean_growth_speed_species |>
  tukey_hsd(mean_growth_speed ~ species)

growth_speed_tukey_results|>
  gt()
```

To complete the test setting the data will also be analysed using a non parametric test. In this case a Kruskal-Wallis test [@tbl-4] and a Dunn post-hoc analysis [@tbl-5] are done

```{r}
#| label: tbl-4
#| tbl-cap: "Kruskal_wallis test significane of growth speed between different species if normal data is not normal distributed"


# Make sure 'species' is a factor
growth_speed_analysis <- growth_speed_analysis |>
  mutate(species = as.factor(species))

# Perform the Kruskal-Wallis test using rstatix
kruskal_result_growth_speed <- growth_speed_analysis |>
  kruskal_test(mean_growth_speed ~ species)


 kruskal_growth_speed_table <- kruskal_result_growth_speed|>
  select(-.y.) %>% # Remove the '.y.' column for cleaner output
  gt()
  
kruskal_growth_speed_table  
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-5
#| tbl-cap: "Dunn test significane of growth speed between different species if normal data is not normal distributed"

dunn_result <- growth_speed_analysis |>
  dunn_test(mean_growth_speed ~ species, p.adjust.method = "bonferroni")|>
  gt()

# Print the Dunn's test results
dunn_result
```

Neither of the used tests under assuming normal distribution or rejecting normal distribution showed significant results between the growth speed of the fungal species in this simulated data set.

## Analysis of bacterial concentration changes

In this section, the bacterial log-change for *E. coli* and *E. faecalis* will be analyzed. This log-change is calculated from the initial bacterial concentration measured in the fecal samples and the concentration measured after co-incubation, indicating the log10​ reduction in bacterial concentration. This normalization is necessary due to varying initial bacterial concentrations in the starting substrate. To test the collected data for normal distribution, a Q-Q plot and a Shapiro-Wilk test is used.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-6
#| tbl-cap: "Shapiro-test for E coli log change in fungal treated faeces compared to uninoculated control"

###Testing data for normal distribution e_coli 
ecoli_log <- bacteria_analysis|>
  dplyr::select(species, log_change_ecoli)

shapiro_ecoli <- ecoli_log |>
  group_by(species)|>
  shapiro_test(log_change_ecoli)

shapiro_ecoli|>
  gt()
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-5
#| fig-cap: "q-q plot for testing for normal distribution of E. coli log change"

###qq-plot for each species 
ggplot(ecoli_log, aes(sample = `log_change_ecoli`)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(vars( species)) +
  geom_qq_line(color = "purple")
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-7
#| tbl-cap: "Shapiro-test for E. faecalis log change in fungal treated faeces compared to uninoculated control"
###Testing data for normal distribution enterococcus 
enterococcus_log <- bacteria_analysis|>
  dplyr::select(species, log_change_enterococcus)

shapiro_enterococcus <- enterococcus_log |>
  group_by(species)|>
  shapiro_test(log_change_enterococcus)

shapiro_enterococcus|>
  gt()

```

The Shapiro test [@tbl-6] and the Q-Q plots [@fig-5] showing that the created log change data for *E. coli* and *E. faecalis* [@tbl-7] and [@fig-6] is normal distributed. This normal distribution allows to use a parametric test. To analyse bacterial log change an ANOVA was used and a Tukey post-hoc analysis to test between different treatment pairs.

```{r}
#| label: fig-6
#| fig-cap: "q-q plot for testing normal distribution of log-change of E. faecalis"

###qq-plot for each species 
ggplot(enterococcus_log, aes(sample = `log_change_enterococcus`)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(vars( species)) +
  geom_qq_line(color = "purple")

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

  mutate(p.adj = scales::pvalue(p.adj))

tukey_results_formatted|>

```

```{r}
#| echo: false

```

    values_to = "log_change"            
  )  

log_change_both$species <- factor(log_change_both$species, levels = c("Control", "P.ostreatus v. Floridae", "C.comatus", "faecal isolate 1"))


  


```

```{r}
#| label: fig-7
#| fig-cap: "Boxplot comparing log change for E. coli and E. faeclis between treatments"

ggplot(log_change_both, aes(x = species, y = log_change, fill = bacteria)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    x = "Species",
    y = "Log Change",
    fill = "Bacteria Species",
    title = "Bacterial Log Change Comparison by Species"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("log_change_ecoli" = "purple", "log_change_enterococcus" = "coral"),
    labels = c("E. coli", "E. faecalis")
  ) +
  #Making lines separating the different species

  geom_vline(xintercept = 2.5,  color = "white") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 3.5, color = "white")+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1), panel.grid.major = element_blank())
```

Within the generated dataset, statistically significant differences (p\<0.05) in the log-change of both *E. coli* and *E. faecalis* were observed across the experimental groups [@tbl-8].

A subsequent Tukey post-hoc analysis for *E. coli* [@tbl-9]) indicated that fungal interventions utilizing *P. ostreatus* and *C. comatus* produced significantly distinct log-change values when compared to the control and fecal isolate 1. In contrast, no significant difference was detected between the control and fecal isolate 1.

For *E. faecalis*, the treatment involving *P. ostreatus* demonstrated a significantly greater log-change in bacterial concentration relative to all other treatments, with no significant differences found among the remaining experimental groups [@tbl-11].

# Conclusions

The developed data structure and scripts can be applied to the test dataset to visualize differences in mean growth speed among species and the log-change in bacterial concentrations before and after fungal growth. For statistical analysis, ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test are suitable for normally distributed data, while the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests are appropriate for non-normally distributed data. Applying these scripts to the actual collected data may require some adaptations, primarily due to necessary modifications in the assay methodology.
